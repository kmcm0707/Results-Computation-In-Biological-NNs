Integration of state-of-the-art memristive devices provides optimal scaling of current technologies beyond this limit through the adoption of neuromorphic models. Universal computing machines pioneered by Alan Turing are strictly based on top-down intelligent design. Neuromorphic models instead engage in bottom-up programmability by emulating mammalian brain design and characteristics. Here we show the design, characterization, and implementation of a massively parallel memristor neuromorphic network based on metal chalcogenide atomic switch network (ASN) systems with key characteristics such as short- and long-term potentiation, power-law dynamics, and scale-free topology.},

  abstract = {Traditional backpropagation of error, though a highly successful algorithm for learning in artificial neural network models, includes features which are biologically implausible for learning in real neural circuits. An alternative called target propagation proposes to solve this implausibility by using a top-down model of neural activity to convert an error at the output of a neural network into layer-wise and plausible 'targets' for every unit. These targets can then be used to produce weight updates for network training. However, thus far, target propagation has been heuristically proposed without demonstrable equivalence to backpropagation. Here, we derive an exact correspondence between backpropagation and a modified form of target propagation (GAIT-prop) where the target is a small perturbation of the forward pass. Specifically, backpropagation and GAIT-prop give identical updates when synaptic weight matrices are orthogonal. In a series of simple computer vision experiments, we show near-identical performance between backpropagation and GAIT-prop with a soft orthogonality-inducing regularizer.},

An algorithm called feedback alignment achieves deep learning without weight transport by using random feedback weights, but it performs poorly on hard visual-recognition tasks. Here we describe two mechanisms - a neural circuit called a weight mirror and a modification of an algorithm proposed by Kolen and Pollack in 1994 - both of which let the feedback path learn appropriate synaptic weights quickly and accurately even in large networks, without weight transport or complex wiring.Tested on the ImageNet visual-recognition task, these mechanisms outperform both feedback alignment and the newer sign-symmetry method, and nearly match backprop, the standard algorithm of deep learning, which uses weight transport.},

There is no good reason for this restriction. Synapses have dynamics at many different time-scales and this suggests that artificial neural networks might benefit from variables that change slower than activities but much faster than the standard weights. These "fast weights" can be used to store temporary memories of the recent past and they provide a neurally plausible way of implementing the type of attention to the past that has recently proved very helpful in sequence-to-sequence models. By using fast weights we can avoid the need to store copies of neural activity patterns.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Theoretical studies have shown that memories last longer if the neural representations are sparse, that is, when each neuron is selective for a small fraction of the events creating the memories. Sparseness reduces both the interference between stored memories and the number of synaptic modifications which are necessary for memory storage. Paradoxically, in cortical areas like the inferotemporal cortex, where presumably memory lifetimes are longer than in the medial temporal lobe, neural representations are less sparse. We resolve this paradox by analyzing the effects of sparseness on complex models of synaptic dynamics in which there are metaplastic states with different degrees of plasticity. For these models, memory retention in a large number of synapses across multiple neurons is significantly more efficient in case of many metaplastic states, that is, for an elevated degree of complexity. In other words, larger brain regions allow to retain memories for significantly longer times only if the synaptic complexity increases with the total number of synapses. However, the initial memory trace, the one experienced immediately after memory storage, becomes weaker both when the number of metaplastic states increases and when the neural representations become sparser. Such a memory trace must be above a given threshold in order to permit every single neuron to retrieve the information stored in its synapses. As a consequence, if the initial memory trace is reduced because of the increased synaptic complexity, then the neural representations must be less sparse. We conclude that long memory lifetimes allowed by a larger number of synapses require more complex synapses, and hence, less sparse representations, which is what is observed in the brain.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The authors discuss an original approach to neural modeling based on the idea of searching, with learning methods, for a synaptic learning rule which is biologically plausible and yields networks that are able to learn to perform difficult tasks. The proposed method of automatically finding the learning rule relies on the idea of considering the synaptic modification rule as a parametric function. This function has local inputs and is the same in many neurons. The parameters that define this function can be estimated with known learning methods. For this optimization, particular attention is given to gradient descent and genetic algorithms. In both cases, estimation of this function consists of a joint global optimization of the synaptic modification function and the networks that are learning to perform some tasks. Both network architecture and the learning function can be designed within constraints derived from biological knowledge.{$<>$}},

The problem is clear in kernel-based approaches when the kernel is "local" (e.g., the Gaussian kernel), i.e., K (x, y ) converges to a constant when {\textbar}{\textbar}x - y {\textbar}{\textbar} increases. These analyses point to the difficulty of learning "highly-varying functions", i.e., functions that have a large number of "variations" in the domain of interest, e.g., they would require a large number of pieces to be well represented by a piecewise-linear approximation. Since the number of pieces can be made to grow exponentially with the number of factors of variations in the input, this is connected with the well-known curse of dimensionality for classical non-parametric learning algorithms (for regression, classification and density estimation). If the shapes of all these pieces are unrelated, one needs enough examples for each piece in order to generalize properly. However, if these shapes are related and can be predicted from each other, "non-local" learning algorithms have the potential to generalize to pieces not covered by the training set. Such ability would seem necessary for learning in complex domains such as Artificial Intelligence tasks (e.g., related to vision, language, speech, robotics). Kernel machines (not only those with a local kernel) have a shallow architecture, i.e., only two levels of data-dependent computational elements. This is also true of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer (which can become SVMs when the number of hidden units becomes large (Bengio, Le Roux, Vincent, Delalleau, \& Marcotte, 2006)). A serious problem with shallow architectures is that they can be very inefficient in terms of the number of computational units (e.g., bases, hidden units), and thus in terms of required examples (Bengio \& Le Cun, 2007). One way to represent a highly-varying function compactly (with few parameters) is through the composition of many non-linearities, i.e., with a deep architecture. For example, the parity function with d inputs requires O(2d ) examples and parameters to be represented by a Gaussian SVM (Bengio et al., 2006), O(d2 ) parameters for a one-hidden-layer neural network, O(d) parameters and units for a multi-layer network with O(log2 d) layers, and O(1) parameters with a recurrent neural network.

To understand the computational principles behind these intricate networks of interactions, we construct a broad class of synaptic models that efficiently harness biological complexity to preserve numerous memories by protecting them against the adverse effects of overwriting. The memory capacity scales almost linearly with the number of synapses, which is a substantial improvement over the square root scaling of previous models. This was achieved by combining multiple dynamical processes that initially store memories in fast variables and then progressively transfer them to slower variables. Notably, the interactions between fast and slow variables are bidirectional. The proposed models are robust to parameter perturbations and can explain several properties of biological memory, including delayed expression of synaptic modifications, metaplasticity, and spacing effects.},

This mechanism is designed to maintain long-term memory for sequence processing but at a reduced computational cost, thereby opening up for more efficient execution or larger models on restricted hardware. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with gating mechanisms such as LSTM and GRU have been widely successful in learning from sequential data due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. Conventionally, the update based on current inputs and the previous state history is each multiplied with dynamic weights and combined to compute the next state. However, multiplication can be computationally expensive, especially for certain hardware architectures or alternative arithmetic systems such as homomorphic encryption. It is demonstrated that the novel gating mechanism can capture long-term dependencies for a standard synthetic sequence learning task while significantly reducing computational costs such that execution time is reduced by half on CPU and by one-third under encryption. Experimental results on handwritten text recognition tasks furthermore show that the proposed architecture can be trained to achieve comparable accuracy to conventional GRU and LSTM baselines. The gating mechanism introduced in this paper may enable privacy-preserving AI applications operating under homomorphic encryption by avoiding the multiplication of encrypted variables. It can also support quantization in (unencrypted) plaintext applications, with the potential for substantial performance gains since the addition-based formulation can avoid the expansion to double precision often required for multiplication.},

Here we show in the hippocampus that long-term, but not short-term, eCB-dependent depression of inhibitory transmission requires presynaptic cAMP/PKA signaling.

Moreover, we show that eCB-dependent LTD in the amygdala and hippocampus shares major mechanistic features.

This is generally attributed to an alignment of the update of the random walker with the true gradient - the eponymous gradient alignment -- which drives an approximate gradient descend. The mechanism that leads to this alignment remains unclear, however. In this paper, we use mathematical reasoning and simulations to investigate gradient alignment. We observe that the feedback alignment update rule has fixed points, which correspond to extrema of the loss function. We show that gradient alignment is a stability criterion for those fixed points. It is only a necessary criterion for algorithm performance. Experimentally, we demonstrate that high levels of gradient alignment can lead to poor algorithm performance and that the alignment is not always driving the gradient descend.},

  abstract = {The search for biologically faithful synaptic plasticity rules has resulted in a large body of models. They are usually inspired by -- and fitted to -- experimental data, but they rarely produce neural dynamics that serve complex functions. These failures suggest that current plasticity models are still under-constrained by existing data. Here, we present an alternative approach that uses meta-learning to discover plausible synaptic plasticity rules. Instead of experimental data, the rules are constrained by the functions they implement and the structure they are meant to produce. Briefly, we parameterize synaptic plasticity rules by a Volterra expansion and then use supervised learning methods (gradient descent or evolutionary strategies) to minimize a problem-dependent loss function that quantifies how effectively a candidate plasticity rule transforms an initially random network into one with the desired function. We first validate our approach by re-discovering previously described plasticity rules, starting at the single-neuron level and Oja's rule'', a simple Hebbian plasticity rule that captures the direction of most variability of inputs to a neuron (i.e., the first principal component). We expand the problem to the network level and ask the framework to find Oja's rule together with an anti-Hebbian rule such that an initially random two-layer firing-rate network will recover several principal components of the input space after learning. Next, we move to networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with plastic inhibitory afferents. We train for rules that achieve a target firing rate by countering tuned excitation. Our algorithm discovers a specific subset of the manifold of rules that can solve this task. Our work is a proof of principle of an automated and unbiased approach to unveil synaptic plasticity rules that obey biological constraints and can solve complex functions.},

Biologically-inspired devices, such as artificial neural networks, can process information with a high level of parallelism to efficiently solve difficult problems, even when implemented using conventional microelectronic technologies. We describe a mechanical device, which operates in a manner similar to artificial neural networks, to solve efficiently two difficult benchmark problems (computing the parity of a bit stream, and classifying spoken words). The device consists in a network of masses coupled by linear springs and attached to a substrate by non-linear springs, thus forming a network of anharmonic oscillators. As the masses can directly couple to forces applied on the device, this approach combines sensing and computing functions in a single power-efficient device with compact dimensions.},

  abstract = {Neural networks are commonly trained to make predictions through learning algorithms. Contrastive Hebbian learning, which is a powerful rule inspired by gradient backpropagation, is based on Hebb's rule and the contrastive divergence algorithm. It operates in two phases, the forward (or free) phase, where the data are fed to the network, and a backward (or clamped) phase, where the target signals are clamped to the output layer of the network and the feedback signals are transformed through the transpose synaptic weight matrices. This implies symmetries at the synaptic level, for which there is no evidence in the brain. In this work, we propose a new variant of the algorithm, called random contrastive Hebbian learning, which does not rely on any synaptic weights symmetries. Instead, it uses random matrices to transform the feedback signals during the clamped phase, and the neural dynamics are described by first order non-linear differential equations. The algorithm is experimentally verified by solving a Boolean logic task, classification tasks (handwritten digits and letters), and an autoencoding task. This article also shows how the parameters affect learning, especially the random matrices. We use the pseudospectra analysis to investigate further how random matrices impact the learning process. Finally, we discuss the biological plausibility of the proposed algorithm, and how it can give rise to better computational models for learning.},

Despite this central principle of cortical organization, it is only slowly becoming recognized that the cortex is a reservoir. Of course there are mechanisms in the cortex that allow for plasticity. But the general model of a reservoir as a recurrent network that creates a high dimensional temporal expansion of its inputs which can then be harvested for extracting the required output is fully achieved by the cortex. Future research will find this obvious. This chapter provides a framework for more clearly understanding this conception of cortex and the corticostriatal system.},

  abstract = {One of the most frequent problems in both decision making and reinforcement learning (RL) is expectation maximization involving functionals such as reward or utility. Generally, these problems consist of computing the optimal solution of a density function. Instead of trying to find this exact solution, a common approach is to approximate it through a learning process. In this work we propose a functional gradient rule for the maximization of a general form of density-dependent functionals using a stochastic gradient ascent algorithm. If a neural network is used for parametrization of the desired density function, the proposed learning rule can be viewed as a modulated Hebbian rule. Such a learning rule is biologically plausible, because it consists of both local and global factors corresponding to the coactivity of pre/post-synaptic neurons and the effect of neuromodulation, respectively. We first apply our technique to standard reward maximization in RL. As expected, this yields the standard policy gradient rule in which parameters of the model are updated proportional to the amount of reward. Next, we use variational free energy as a functional and find that the estimated change in parameters is modulated by a measure of surprise signal. Finally, we propose an information theoretical equivalent of existing models in expected utility maximization, as a standard model of decision making, to incorporate both individual preferences and choice variability. We show that our technique can also be applied into such novel framework.},

Models in which memories are stored through switch-like transitions in synaptic efficacy are good at storing but bad at retaining memories if these transitions are likely, and they are poor at storage but good at retention if they are unlikely. We construct and study a model in which each synapse has a cascade of states with different levels of plasticity, connected by metaplastic transitions. This cascade model combines high levels of memory storage with long retention times and significantly outperforms alternative models. As a result, we suggest that memory storage requires synapses with multiple states exhibiting dynamics over a wide range of timescales, and we suggest experimental tests of this hypothesis.},

Short memory lifetimes arise from the bounds that must be imposed on synaptic efficacy in any realistic model. We explored whether memory performance can be improved by allowing synapses to traverse a large number of states before reaching their bounds, or by changing the way these bounds are imposed. In the case of hard bounds, memory lifetimes grow proportional to the square of the number of synaptic states, but only if potentiation and depression are precisely balanced. Improved performance can be obtained without fine tuning by imposing soft bounds, but this improvement is only linear with respect to the number of synaptic states. We explored several other possibilities and conclude that improving memory performance requires a more radical modification of the standard model of memory storage.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has led to significant advances in artificial intelligence, in part, by adopting strategies motivated by neurophysiology. However, it is unclear whether deep learning could occur in the real brain. Here, we show that a deep learning algorithm that utilizes multi-compartment neurons might help us to understand how the neocortex optimizes cost functions. Like neocortical pyramidal neurons, neurons in our model receive sensory information and higher-order feedback in electrotonically segregated compartments. Thanks to this segregation, neurons in different layers of the network can coordinate synaptic weight updates. As a result, the network learns to categorize images better than a single layer network. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm takes advantage of multilayer architectures to identify useful higher-order representations---the hallmark of deep learning. This work demonstrates that deep learning can be achieved using segregated dendritic compartments, which may help to explain the morphology of neocortical pyramidal neurons., Artificial intelligence has made major progress in recent years thanks to a technique known as deep learning, which works by mimicking the human brain. When computers employ deep learning, they learn by using networks made up of many layers of simulated neurons. Deep learning has opened the door to computers with human -- or even super-human -- levels of skill in recognizing images, processing speech and controlling vehicles. But many neuroscientists are skeptical about whether the brain itself performs deep learning., The patterns of activity that occur in computer networks during deep learning resemble those seen in human brains. But some features of deep learning seem incompatible with how the brain works. Moreover, neurons in artificial networks are much simpler than our own neurons. For instance, in the region of the brain responsible for thinking and planning, most neurons have complex tree-like shapes. Each cell has `roots' deep inside the brain and `branches' close to the surface. By contrast, simulated neurons have a uniform structure., To find out whether networks made up of more realistic simulated neurons could be used to make deep learning more biologically realistic, Guerguiev et al. designed artificial neurons with two compartments, similar to the `roots' and `branches'. The network learned to recognize hand-written digits more easily when it had many layers than when it had only a few. This shows that artificial neurons more like those in the brain can enable deep learning. It even suggests that our own neurons may have evolved their shape to support this process., If confirmed, the link between neuronal shape and deep learning could help us develop better brain-computer interfaces. These allow people to use their brain activity to control devices such as artificial limbs. Despite advances in computing, we are still superior to computers when it comes to learning. Understanding how our own brains show deep learning could thus help us develop better, more human-like artificial intelligence in the future.},

Though they are also reminiscent of HyperNEAT in evolution, our hypernetworks are trained end-to-end with backpropagation and thus are usually faster. The focus of this work is to make hypernetworks useful for deep convolutional networks and long recurrent networks, where hypernetworks can be viewed as relaxed form of weight-sharing across layers. Our main result is that hypernetworks can generate non-shared weights for LSTM and achieve near state-of-the-art results on a variety of sequence modelling tasks including character-level language modelling, handwriting generation and neural machine translation, challenging the weight-sharing paradigm for recurrent networks. Our results also show that hypernetworks applied to convolutional networks still achieve respectable results for image recognition tasks compared to state-of-the-art baseline models while requiring fewer learnable parameters.},

Second, the DFA with the sparse backward weight is applied. It comes with a form of dilated convolution in the CNN case, and in a form of sparse matrix multiplication in the RNN case. Additionally, the error propagation method of CNN becomes simpler through the group convolution.

A precise criterion for this synchronization is given by a quantity called the conditional Lyapunov exponent. We describe a class of dynamical systems (physical systems) that are utilizable for RC in terms of this quantity. Then, two notions characterizing the information processing performance of RC are illustrated: (i) Edge of Chaos and (ii) Memory-Nonlinearity Trade-off. Based on the notion (ii), a structure of dynamical systems suitable for RC has been proposed. This structure is called the mixture reservoir. We review the structure and show its remarkable information processing performance.},

  abstract = {Synaptic plasticity is a complex phenomenon involving multiple biochemical processes that operate on different timescales. Complexity can greatly increase memory capacity when the variables characterizing the synaptic dynamics have limited precision, as shown in simple memory retrieval problems involving random patterns. Here we turn to a real-world problem, face familiarity detection, and we show that synaptic complexity can be harnessed to store in memory a large number of faces that can be recognized at a later time. The number of recognizable faces grows almost linearly with the number of synapses and quadratically with the number of neurons. Complex synapses outperform simple ones characterized by a single variable, even when the total number of dynamical variables is matched. Complex and simple synapses have distinct signatures that are testable in experiments. Our results indicate that a system with complex synapses can be used in real-world tasks such as face familiarity detection.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the novel concept of weight correlation in deep neural networks and discusses its impact on the networks' generalisation ability. For fully-connected layers, the weight correlation is defined as the average cosine similarity between weight vectors of neurons, and for convolutional layers, the weight correlation is defined as the cosine similarity between filter matrices. Theoretically, we show that, weight correlation can, and should, be incorporated into the PAC Bayesian framework for the generalisation of neural networks, and the resulting generalisation bound is monotonic with respect to the weight correlation. We formulate a new complexity measure,  which lifts the PAC Bayes measure  with weight correlation, and experimentally confirm that it is able to rank the generalisation errors of a set of networks more precisely than existing measures. More importantly, we develop a new regulariser for training, and provide extensive experiments that show that the generalisation error can be greatly reduced with our novel approach.},

  abstract = {Pavlovian fear conditioning is a particularly useful behavioral paradigm for exploring the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory because a well-defined response to a specific environmental stimulus is produced through associative learning processes. Synaptic plasticity in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) underlies this form of associative learning. Here, we summarize the molecular mechanisms that contribute to this synaptic plasticity in the context of auditory fear conditioning, the form of fear conditioning best understood at the molecular level. We discuss the neurotransmitter systems and signaling cascades that contribute to three phases of auditory fear conditioning: acquisition, consolidation, and reconsolidation. These studies suggest that multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including those triggered by activation of Hebbian processes and neuromodulatory receptors, interact to produce neural plasticity in the LA and behavioral fear conditioning. Collectively, this body of research illustrates the power of fear conditioning as a model system for characterizing the mechanisms of learning and memory in mammals and potentially for understanding fear-related disorders, such as PTSD and phobias.},

Whereas in a neural network the parameters are typically modelled as scalar values, an individual synapse in the brain comprises a complex network of interacting biochemical components that evolve at different timescales. In this paper, we show that by equipping tabular and deep reinforcement learning agents with a synaptic model that incorporates this biological complexity (Benna \& Fusi, 2016), catastrophic forgetting can be mitigated at multiple timescales. In particular, we find that as well as enabling continual learning across sequential training of two simple tasks, it can also be used to overcome within-task forgetting by reducing the need for an experience replay database.},

This deep architecture is representationally powerful, but complicates learning because it is difficult to identify the responsible neurons when a mistake is made. In machine learning, the backpropagation algorithm assigns blame by multiplying error signals with all the synaptic weights on each neuron's axon and further downstream. However, this involves a precise, symmetric backward connectivity pattern, which is thought to be impossible in the brain. Here we demonstrate that this strong architectural constraint is not required for effective error propagation. We present a surprisingly simple mechanism that assigns blame by multiplying errors by even random synaptic weights. This mechanism can transmit teaching signals across multiple layers of neurons and performs as effectively as backpropagation on a variety of tasks. Our results help reopen questions about how the brain could use error signals and dispel long-held assumptions about algorithmic constraints on learning.,  Multi-layered neural architectures that implement learning require elaborate mechanisms for symmetric backpropagation of errors that are biologically implausible. Here the authors propose a simple resolution to this problem of blame assignment that works even with feedback using random synaptic weights.},

  abstract = {Backpropagation is a cornerstone algorithm in training neural networks for supervised learning, which uses a gradient descent method to update network weights by minimizing the discrepancy between actual and desired outputs. Despite its pivotal role in propelling deep learning advancements, the biological plausibility of backpropagation is questioned due to its requirements for weight symmetry, global error computation, and dual-phase training. To address this long-standing challenge, many studies have endeavored to devise biologically plausible training algorithms. However, a fully biologically plausible algorithm for training multilayer neural networks remains elusive, and interpretations of biological plausibility vary among researchers. In this study, we establish criteria for biological plausibility that a desirable learning algorithm should meet. Using these criteria, we evaluate a range of existing algorithms considered to be biologically plausible, including Hebbian learning, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, feedback alignment, target propagation, predictive coding, forward-forward algorithm, perturbation learning, local losses, and energy-based learning. Additionally, we empirically evaluate these algorithms across diverse network architectures and datasets. We compare the feature representations learned by these algorithms with brain activity recorded by non-invasive devices under identical stimuli, aiming to identify which algorithm can most accurately replicate brain activity patterns. We are hopeful that this study could inspire the development of new biologically plausible algorithms for training multilayer networks, thereby fostering progress in both the fields of neuroscience and machine learning.},

Typically, this involves minimizing a surrogate objective, such as the negative log likelihood of a generative model, with the hope that representations useful for subsequent tasks will arise as a side effect. In this work, we propose instead to directly target later desired tasks by meta-learning an unsupervised learning rule which leads to representations useful for those tasks. Specifically, we target semi-supervised classification performance, and we meta-learn an algorithm --an unsupervised weight update rule -- that produces representations useful for this task. Additionally, we constrain our unsupervised update rule to a be a biologically-motivated, neuron-local function, which enables it to generalize to different neural network architectures, datasets, and data modalities. We show that the meta-learned update rule produces useful features and sometimes outperforms existing unsupervised learning techniques. We further show that the meta-learned unsupervised update rule generalizes to train networks with different widths, depths, and nonlinearities. It also generalizes to train on data with randomly permuted input dimensions and even generalizes from image datasets to a text task.},

These efforts are challenged by biologically implausible features of backpropagation, one of which is a reliance on symmetric forward and backward synaptic weights. A number of methods have been proposed that do not rely on weight symmetry but, thus far, these have failed to scale to deep convolutional networks and complex data. We identify principal obstacles to the scalability of such algorithms and introduce several techniques to mitigate them.

In addition to providing mathematical arguments for the effectiveness of the new learning rule, we show through simulations that it can be used to train an RNN to perform a variety of tasks.

Rules that train neural networks to map stimuli onto outputs are given by supervised learning and reinforcement learning theories. Supervised learning is efficient but biologically implausible. In contrast, reinforcement learning is biologically plausible but comparatively inefficient. It lacks a mechanism that can identify units at early processing levels that play a decisive role in the stimulus-response mapping. Here we show that this so-called credit assignment problem can be solved by a new role for attention in learning. There are two factors in our new learning scheme that determine synaptic plasticity: (1) a reinforcement signal that is homogeneous across the network and depends on the amount of reward obtained after a trial, and (2) an attentional feedback signal from the output layer that limits plasticity to those units at earlier processing levels that are crucial for the stimulus-response mapping. The new scheme is called attention-gated reinforcement learning (AGREL). We show that it is as efficient as supervised learning in classification tasks. AGREL is biologically realistic and integrates the role of feedback connections, attention effects, synaptic plasticity, and reinforcement learning signals into a coherent framework.},

  abstract = {We introduce Equilibrium Propagation, a learning framework for energy-based models. It involves only one kind of neural computation, performed in both the first phase (when the prediction is made) and the second phase of training (after the target or prediction error is revealed). Although this algorithm computes the gradient of an objective function just like Backpropagation, it does not need a special computation or circuit for the second phase, where errors are implicitly propagated. Equilibrium Propagation shares similarities with Contrastive Hebbian Learning and Contrastive Divergence while solving the theoretical issues of both algorithms: our algorithm computes the gradient of a well defined objective function. Because the objective function is defined in terms of local perturbations, the second phase of Equilibrium Propagation corresponds to only nudging the prediction (fixed point, or stationary distribution) towards a configuration that reduces prediction error. In the case of a recurrent multi-layer supervised network, the output units are slightly nudged towards their target in the second phase, and the perturbation introduced at the output layer propagates backward in the hidden layers. We show that the signal 'back-propagated' during this second phase corresponds to the propagation of error derivatives and encodes the gradient of the objective function, when the synaptic update corresponds to a standard form of spike-timing dependent plasticity. This work makes it more plausible that a mechanism similar to Backpropagation could be implemented by brains, since leaky integrator neural computation performs both inference and error back-propagation in our model. The only local difference between the two phases is whether synaptic changes are allowed or not.},

Some biological models of backpropagation rely on feedback projections that are symmetric with feedforward connections, but experiments do not corroborate the existence of such symmetric backward connectivity. Random feedback alignment offers an alternative model in which errors are propagated backward through fixed, random backward connections. This approach successfully trains shallow models, but learns slowly and does not perform well with deeper models or online learning. In this study, we develop a meta-learning approach to discover interpretable, biologically plausible plasticity rules that improve online learning performance with fixed random feedback connections. The resulting plasticity rules show improved online training of deep models in the low data regime. Our results highlight the potential of meta-learning to discover effective, interpretable learning rules satisfying biological constraints.},

Natural processing architectures are characterized by recurrence and therefore exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics. Moreover, they use learning mechanisms that support self-organization.

  abstract = {Training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has become a go-to approach for generating and evaluating mechanistic neural hypotheses for cognition. The ease and efficiency of training RNNs with backpropagation through time and the availability of robustly supported deep learning libraries has made RNN modeling more approachable and accessible to neuroscience. Yet, a major technical hindrance remains. Cognitive processes such as working memory and decision making involve neural population dynamics over a long period of time within a behavioral trial and across trials. It is difficult to train RNNs to accomplish tasks where neural representations and dynamics have long temporal dependencies without gating mechanisms such as LSTMs or GRUs which currently lack experimental support and prohibit direct comparison between RNNs and biological neural circuits. We tackled this problem based on the idea of specialized skip-connections through time to support the emergence of task-relevant dynamics, and subsequently reinstitute biological plausibility by reverting to the original architecture. We show that this approach enables RNNs to successfully learn cognitive tasks that prove impractical if not impossible to learn using conventional methods. Over numerous tasks considered here, we achieve less training steps and shorter wall-clock times, particularly in tasks that require learning long-term dependencies via temporal integration over long timescales or maintaining a memory of past events in hidden-states. Our methods expand the range of experimental tasks that biologically plausible RNN models can learn, thereby supporting the development of theory for the emergent neural mechanisms of computations involving long-term dependencies.},

  abstract = {The common procedure in reservoir computing is to take a ``found'' reservoir, such as a recurrent neural network with randomly chosen synaptic weights or a complex physical device, and to adapt the weights of linear readouts from this reservoir for a particular computing task. We address the question of whether the performance of reservoir computing can be significantly enhanced if one instead optimizes some (hyper)parameters of the reservoir, not for a single task but for the range of all possible tasks in which one is potentially interested, before the weights of linear readouts are optimized for a particular computing task. After all, networks of neurons in the brain are also known to be not randomly connected. Rather, their structure and parameters emerge from complex evolutionary and developmental processes, arguably in a way that enhances the speed and accuracy of subsequent learning of any concrete task that is likely to be essential for the survival of the organism. We apply the Learning-to-Learn (L2L) paradigm to mimic this two-tier process, where a set of (hyper)parameters of the reservoir are optimized for a whole family of learning tasks. We found that this substantially enhances the performance of reservoir computing for the families of tasks that we considered. Furthermore, L2L enables a new form of reservoir learning that tends to enable even faster learning, where not even the weights of readouts need to be adjusted for learning a concrete task. We present demos and performance results of these new forms of reservoir computing for reservoirs that consist of networks of spiking neurons and are hence of particular interest from the perspective of neuroscience and implementations in spike-based neuromorphic hardware. We leave it as an open question of what performance advantage the new methods that we propose provide for other types of reservoirs.},

  abstract = {Reservoir computing is a computational framework suited for temporal/sequential data processing. It is derived from several recurrent neural network models, including echo state networks and liquid state machines. A reservoir computing system consists of a reservoir for mapping inputs into a high-dimensional space and a readout for pattern analysis from the high-dimensional states in the reservoir. The reservoir is fixed and only the readout is trained with a simple method such as linear regression and classification. Thus, the major advantage of reservoir computing compared to other recurrent neural networks is fast learning, resulting in low training cost. Another advantage is that the reservoir without adaptive updating is amenable to hardware implementation using a variety of physical systems, substrates, and devices. In fact, such physical reservoir computing has attracted increasing attention in diverse fields of research. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of recent advances in physical reservoir computing by classifying them according to the type of the reservoir. We discuss the current issues and perspectives related to physical reservoir computing, in order to further expand its practical applications and develop next-generation machine learning systems.},

  abstract = {The development of hardware neural networks, including neuromorphic hardware, has been accelerated over the past few years. However, it is challenging to operate very large-scale neural networks with low-power hardware devices, partly due to signal transmissions through a massive number of interconnections. Our aim is to deal with the issue of communication cost from an algorithmic viewpoint and study learning algorithms for energy-efficient information processing. Here, we consider two approaches to finding spatially arranged sparse recurrent neural networks with the high cost-performance ratio for associative memory. In the first approach following classical methods, we focus on sparse modular network structures inspired by biological brain networks and examine their storage capacity under an iterative learning rule. We show that incorporating long-range intermodule connections into purely modular networks can enhance the cost-performance ratio. In the second approach, we formulate for the first time an optimization problem where the network sparsity is maximized under the constraints imposed by a pattern embedding condition. We show that there is a tradeoff between the interconnection cost and the computational performance in the optimized networks. We demonstrate that the optimized networks can achieve a better cost-performance ratio compared with those considered in the first approach. We show the effectiveness of the optimization approach mainly using binary patterns and apply it also to gray-scale image restoration. Our results suggest that the presented approaches are useful in seeking more sparse and less costly connectivity of neural networks for the enhancement of energy efficiency in hardware neural networks.},

A reservoir computing system consists of a reservoir part represented as a sparsely connected recurrent neural network and a readout part represented as a simple regression model. In machine learning tasks, the reservoir part is fixed and only the readout part is trained. Although reservoir computing has been mainly applied to time series prediction and recognition, it can be applied to image recognition as well by considering an image data as a sequence of pixel values. However, to achieve a high performance in image recognition with raw image data, a large-scale reservoir including a large number of neurons is required. This is a bottleneck in terms of computer memory and computational cost. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a new method which combines reservoir computing with untrained convolutional neural networks. We use an untrained convolutional neural network to transform raw image data into a set of smaller feature maps in a preprocessing step of the reservoir computing. We demonstrate that our method achieves a high classification accuracy in an image recognition task with a much smaller number of trainable parameters compared with a previous study.},

Recent studies in both heterologous expression systems and cultured neurons have shown that the AMPA receptor can be phosphorylated on their subunits (GluR1, GluR2, and GluR4). All phosphorylation sites reside at serine, threonine, or tyrosine on the intracellular C-terminal domain. Several key protein kinases, such as protein kinase A, protein kinase C, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and tyrosine kinases (Trks; receptor or nonreceptor family Trks) are involved in the site-specific regulation of the AMPA receptor phosphorylation. Other glutamate receptors (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors) also regulate AMPA receptors through a protein phosphorylation mechanism. Emerging evidence shows that as a rapid and short-term mechanism, the dynamic protein phosphorylation directly modulates the electrophysiological, morphological (externalization and internalization trafficking and clustering), and biochemical (synthesis and subunit composition) properties of the AMPA receptor, as well as protein-protein interactions between the AMPA receptor subunits and various intracellular interacting proteins. These modulations underlie the major molecular mechanisms that ultimately affect many forms of synaptic plasticity.},

During training, only the connections from the reservoir to these output units are learned. A key requisite for output-only training is the echo state property (ESP), which means that the effect of initial conditions should vanish as time passes. In this paper, we use analytical examples to show that a widely used criterion for the ESP, the spectral radius of the weight matrix being smaller than unity, is not sufficient to satisfy the echo state property. We obtain these examples by investigating local bifurcation properties of the standard ESNs. Moreover, we provide new sufficient conditions for the echo state property of standard sigmoid and leaky integrator ESNs. We furthermore suggest an improved technical definition of the echo state property, and discuss what practicians should (and should not) observe when they optimize their reservoirs for specific tasks.},

  abstract = {Discriminative Fine-Tuning is a fine-tuning strategy that is used for ULMFiT type models. Instead of using the same learning rate for all layers of the model, discriminative fine-tuning allows us to tune each layer with different learning rates. For context, the regular stochastic gradient descent (SGD) update of a model's parameters \${\textbackslash}theta\$ at time step \$t\$ looks like the following (Ruder, 2016): \$\$ {\textbackslash}theta\_\{t\} = {\textbackslash}theta\_\{t-1\} - {\textbackslash}eta{\textbackslash}cdot{\textbackslash}nabla\_\{{\textbackslash}theta\}J{\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}theta{\textbackslash}right)\$\$ where \${\textbackslash}eta\$ is the learning rate and \${\textbackslash}nabla\_\{{\textbackslash}theta\}J{\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}theta{\textbackslash}right)\$ is the gradient with regard to the model's objective function. For discriminative fine-tuning, we split the parameters \${\textbackslash}theta\$ into \{\${\textbackslash}theta\_\{1\}, {\textbackslash}ldots, {\textbackslash}theta\_\{L\}\$\} where \${\textbackslash}theta\_\{l\}\$ contains the parameters of the model at the \$l\$-th layer and \$L\$ is the number of layers of the model. Similarly, we obtain \{\${\textbackslash}eta\_\{1\}, {\textbackslash}ldots, {\textbackslash}eta\_\{L\}\$\} where \${\textbackslash}theta\_\{l\}\$ where \${\textbackslash}eta\_\{l\}\$ is the learning rate of the \$l\$-th layer. The SGD update with discriminative finetuning is then: \$\$ {\textbackslash}theta\_\{t\}{\textasciicircum}\{l\} = {\textbackslash}theta\_\{t-1\}{\textasciicircum}\{l\} - {\textbackslash}eta{\textasciicircum}\{l\}{\textbackslash}cdot{\textbackslash}nabla\_\{{\textbackslash}theta{\textasciicircum}\{l\}\}J{\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}theta{\textbackslash}right) \$\$ The authors find that empirically it worked well to first choose the learning rate \${\textbackslash}eta{\textasciicircum}\{L\}\$ of the last layer by fine-tuning only the last layer and using \${\textbackslash}eta{\textasciicircum}\{l-1\}={\textbackslash}eta{\textasciicircum}\{l\}/2.6\$ as the learning rate for lower layers.},
