Integration of state-of-the-art memristive devices provides optimal scaling of current technologies beyond this limit through the adoption of neuromorphic models. Universal computing machines pioneered by Alan Turing are strictly based on top-down intelligent design. Neuromorphic models instead engage in bottom-up programmability by emulating mammalian brain design and characteristics. Here we show the design, characterization, and implementation of a massively parallel memristor neuromorphic network based on metal chalcogenide atomic switch network (ASN) systems with key characteristics such as short- and long-term potentiation, power-law dynamics, and scale-free topology.},

  abstract = {Traditional backpropagation of error, though a highly successful algorithm for learning in artificial neural network models, includes features which are biologically implausible for learning in real neural circuits. An alternative called target propagation proposes to solve this implausibility by using a top-down model of neural activity to convert an error at the output of a neural network into layer-wise and plausible 'targets' for every unit. These targets can then be used to produce weight updates for network training. However, thus far, target propagation has been heuristically proposed without demonstrable equivalence to backpropagation. Here, we derive an exact correspondence between backpropagation and a modified form of target propagation (GAIT-prop) where the target is a small perturbation of the forward pass. Specifically, backpropagation and GAIT-prop give identical updates when synaptic weight matrices are orthogonal. In a series of simple computer vision experiments, we show near-identical performance between backpropagation and GAIT-prop with a soft orthogonality-inducing regularizer.},

  abstract = {We show that deep networks can be trained using Hebbian updates yielding similar performance to ordinary back-propagation on challenging image datasets. To overcome the unrealistic symmetry in connections between layers, implicit in back-propagation, the feedback weights are separate from the feedforward weights. The feedback weights are also updated with a local rule, the same as the feedforward weights---a weight is updated solely based on the product of activity of the units it connects. With fixed feedback weights as proposed in Lillicrap et al. (2016) performance degrades quickly as the depth of the network increases. If the feedforward and feedback weights are initialized with the same values, as proposed in Zipser and Rumelhart (1990), they remain the same throughout training thus precisely implementing back-propagation. We show that even when the weights are initialized differently and at random, and the algorithm is no longer performing back-propagation, performance is comparable on challenging datasets. We also propose a cost function whose derivative can be represented as a local Hebbian update on the last layer. Convolutional layers are updated with tied weights across space, which is not biologically plausible. We show that similar performance is achieved with untied layers, also known as locally connected layers, corresponding to the connectivity implied by the convolutional layers, but where weights are untied and updated separately. In the linear case we show theoretically that the convergence of the error to zero is accelerated by the update of the feedback weights.},

There is no good reason for this restriction. Synapses have dynamics at many different time-scales and this suggests that artificial neural networks might benefit from variables that change slower than activities but much faster than the standard weights. These "fast weights" can be used to store temporary memories of the recent past and they provide a neurally plausible way of implementing the type of attention to the past that has recently proved very helpful in sequence-to-sequence models. By using fast weights we can avoid the need to store copies of neural activity patterns.},

The advent of single-cell multi-omics technologies has led to the development of novel computational methods that leverage genomic, transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility information to infer GRNs at an unprecedented resolution. Here, we review the key principles of inferring GRNs that encompass transcription factor--gene interactions from transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility data.

The recent success of deep networks in machine learning and AI, however, has inspired proposals for understanding how the brain might learn across multiple layers, and hence how it might approximate BP. As of yet, none of these proposals have been rigorously evaluated on tasks where BP-guided deep learning has proved critical, or in architectures more structured than simple fully-connected networks. Here we present results on scaling up biologically motivated models of deep learning on datasets which need deep networks with appropriate architectures to achieve good performance. We present results on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets and explore variants of target-propagation (TP) and feedback alignment (FA) algorithms, and explore performance in both fully- and locally-connected architectures. We also introduce weight-transport-free variants of difference target propagation (DTP) modified to remove backpropagation from the penultimate layer. Many of these algorithms perform well for MNIST, but for CIFAR and ImageNet we find that TP and FA variants perform significantly worse than BP, especially for networks composed of locally connected units, opening questions about whether new architectures and algorithms are required to scale these approaches. Our results and implementation details help establish baselines for biologically motivated deep learning schemes going forward.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Theoretical studies have shown that memories last longer if the neural representations are sparse, that is, when each neuron is selective for a small fraction of the events creating the memories. Sparseness reduces both the interference between stored memories and the number of synaptic modifications which are necessary for memory storage. Paradoxically, in cortical areas like the inferotemporal cortex, where presumably memory lifetimes are longer than in the medial temporal lobe, neural representations are less sparse. We resolve this paradox by analyzing the effects of sparseness on complex models of synaptic dynamics in which there are metaplastic states with different degrees of plasticity. For these models, memory retention in a large number of synapses across multiple neurons is significantly more efficient in case of many metaplastic states, that is, for an elevated degree of complexity. In other words, larger brain regions allow to retain memories for significantly longer times only if the synaptic complexity increases with the total number of synapses. However, the initial memory trace, the one experienced immediately after memory storage, becomes weaker both when the number of metaplastic states increases and when the neural representations become sparser. Such a memory trace must be above a given threshold in order to permit every single neuron to retrieve the information stored in its synapses. As a consequence, if the initial memory trace is reduced because of the increased synaptic complexity, then the neural representations must be less sparse. We conclude that long memory lifetimes allowed by a larger number of synapses require more complex synapses, and hence, less sparse representations, which is what is observed in the brain.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The authors discuss an original approach to neural modeling based on the idea of searching, with learning methods, for a synaptic learning rule which is biologically plausible and yields networks that are able to learn to perform difficult tasks. The proposed method of automatically finding the learning rule relies on the idea of considering the synaptic modification rule as a parametric function. This function has local inputs and is the same in many neurons. The parameters that define this function can be estimated with known learning methods. For this optimization, particular attention is given to gradient descent and genetic algorithms. In both cases, estimation of this function consists of a joint global optimization of the synaptic modification function and the networks that are learning to perform some tasks. Both network architecture and the learning function can be designed within constraints derived from biological knowledge.{$<>$}},

The problem is clear in kernel-based approaches when the kernel is "local" (e.g., the Gaussian kernel), i.e., K (x, y ) converges to a constant when {\textbar}{\textbar}x - y {\textbar}{\textbar} increases. These analyses point to the difficulty of learning "highly-varying functions", i.e., functions that have a large number of "variations" in the domain of interest, e.g., they would require a large number of pieces to be well represented by a piecewise-linear approximation. Since the number of pieces can be made to grow exponentially with the number of factors of variations in the input, this is connected with the well-known curse of dimensionality for classical non-parametric learning algorithms (for regression, classification and density estimation). If the shapes of all these pieces are unrelated, one needs enough examples for each piece in order to generalize properly. However, if these shapes are related and can be predicted from each other, "non-local" learning algorithms have the potential to generalize to pieces not covered by the training set. Such ability would seem necessary for learning in complex domains such as Artificial Intelligence tasks (e.g., related to vision, language, speech, robotics). Kernel machines (not only those with a local kernel) have a shallow architecture, i.e., only two levels of data-dependent computational elements. This is also true of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer (which can become SVMs when the number of hidden units becomes large (Bengio, Le Roux, Vincent, Delalleau, \& Marcotte, 2006)). A serious problem with shallow architectures is that they can be very inefficient in terms of the number of computational units (e.g., bases, hidden units), and thus in terms of required examples (Bengio \& Le Cun, 2007). One way to represent a highly-varying function compactly (with few parameters) is through the composition of many non-linearities, i.e., with a deep architecture. For example, the parity function with d inputs requires O(2d ) examples and parameters to be represented by a Gaussian SVM (Bengio et al., 2006), O(d2 ) parameters for a one-hidden-layer neural network, O(d) parameters and units for a multi-layer network with O(log2 d) layers, and O(1) parameters with a recurrent neural network.

To understand the computational principles behind these intricate networks of interactions, we construct a broad class of synaptic models that efficiently harness biological complexity to preserve numerous memories by protecting them against the adverse effects of overwriting. The memory capacity scales almost linearly with the number of synapses, which is a substantial improvement over the square root scaling of previous models. This was achieved by combining multiple dynamical processes that initially store memories in fast variables and then progressively transfer them to slower variables. Notably, the interactions between fast and slow variables are bidirectional. The proposed models are robust to parameter perturbations and can explain several properties of biological memory, including delayed expression of synaptic modifications, metaplasticity, and spacing effects.},

A synaptic evolution scheme of a new kind is proposed in which incoming patterns rather than converging afferents compete. The change in the efficacy of a given synapse depends not only on instantaneous pre- and postsynaptic activities but also on a slowly varying time-averaged value of the postsynaptic activity. Assuming an appropriate nonlinear form for this dependence, development of selectivity is obtained under quite general conditions on the sensory environment. One does not require nonlinearity of the neuron's integrative power nor does one need to assume any particular form for intracortical circuitry. This is first illustrated in simple cases, e.g., when the environment consists of only two different stimuli presented alternately in a random manner. The following formal statement then holds: the state of the system converges with probability 1 to points of maximum selectivity in the state space. We next consider the problem of early development of orientation selectivity and binocular interaction in primary visual cortex. Giving the environment an appropriate form, we obtain orientation tuning curves and ocular dominance comparable to what is observed in normally reared adult cats or monkeys. Simulations with binocular input and various types of normal or altered environments show good agreement with the relevant experimental data. Experiments are suggested that could test our theory further.},

  abstract = {We replace the multiplication and sigmoid function of the conventional recurrent gate with addition and ReLU activation. This mechanism is designed to maintain long-term memory for sequence processing but at a reduced computational cost, thereby opening up for more efficient execution or larger models on restricted hardware. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with gating mechanisms such as LSTM and GRU have been widely successful in learning from sequential data due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. Conventionally, the update based on current inputs and the previous state history is each multiplied with dynamic weights and combined to compute the next state. However, multiplication can be computationally expensive, especially for certain hardware architectures or alternative arithmetic systems such as homomorphic encryption. It is demonstrated that the novel gating mechanism can capture long-term dependencies for a standard synthetic sequence learning task while significantly reducing computational costs such that execution time is reduced by half on CPU and by one-third under encryption. Experimental results on handwritten text recognition tasks furthermore show that the proposed architecture can be trained to achieve comparable accuracy to conventional GRU and LSTM baselines. The gating mechanism introduced in this paper may enable privacy-preserving AI applications operating under homomorphic encryption by avoiding the multiplication of encrypted variables. It can also support quantization in (unencrypted) plaintext applications, with the potential for substantial performance gains since the addition-based formulation can avoid the expansion to double precision often required for multiplication.},

While the presynaptic mechanisms underlying eCB-dependent short-term depression have been identified, the molecular events linking CB1 receptors to LTD are unknown. Here we show in the hippocampus that long-term, but not short-term, eCB-dependent depression of inhibitory transmission requires presynaptic cAMP/PKA signaling. We further identify the active zone protein RIM1alpha as a key mediator of both CB1 receptor effects on the release machinery and eCB-dependent LTD in the hippocampus. Moreover, we show that eCB-dependent LTD in the amygdala and hippocampus shares major mechanistic features. These findings reveal the signaling pathway by which CB1 receptors mediate long-term effects of eCBs in two crucial brain structures. Furthermore, our results highlight a conserved mechanism of presynaptic plasticity in the brain.},

  abstract = {The search for biologically faithful synaptic plasticity rules has resulted in a large body of models. They are usually inspired by -- and fitted to -- experimental data, but they rarely produce neural dynamics that serve complex functions. These failures suggest that current plasticity models are still under-constrained by existing data. Here, we present an alternative approach that uses meta-learning to discover plausible synaptic plasticity rules. Instead of experimental data, the rules are constrained by the functions they implement and the structure they are meant to produce. Briefly, we parameterize synaptic plasticity rules by a Volterra expansion and then use supervised learning methods (gradient descent or evolutionary strategies) to minimize a problem-dependent loss function that quantifies how effectively a candidate plasticity rule transforms an initially random network into one with the desired function. We first validate our approach by re-discovering previously described plasticity rules, starting at the single-neuron level and Oja's rule'', a simple Hebbian plasticity rule that captures the direction of most variability of inputs to a neuron (i.e., the first principal component). We expand the problem to the network level and ask the framework to find Oja's rule together with an anti-Hebbian rule such that an initially random two-layer firing-rate network will recover several principal components of the input space after learning. Next, we move to networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with plastic inhibitory afferents. We train for rules that achieve a target firing rate by countering tuned excitation. Our algorithm discovers a specific subset of the manifold of rules that can solve this task. Our work is a proof of principle of an automated and unbiased approach to unveil synaptic plasticity rules that obey biological constraints and can solve complex functions.},

We describe a mechanical device, which operates in a manner similar to artificial neural networks, to solve efficiently two difficult benchmark problems (computing the parity of a bit stream, and classifying spoken words). The device consists in a network of masses coupled by linear springs and attached to a substrate by non-linear springs, thus forming a network of anharmonic oscillators. As the masses can directly couple to forces applied on the device, this approach combines sensing and computing functions in a single power-efficient device with compact dimensions.},

  abstract = {Neural networks are commonly trained to make predictions through learning algorithms. Contrastive Hebbian learning, which is a powerful rule inspired by gradient backpropagation, is based on Hebb's rule and the contrastive divergence algorithm. It operates in two phases, the forward (or free) phase, where the data are fed to the network, and a backward (or clamped) phase, where the target signals are clamped to the output layer of the network and the feedback signals are transformed through the transpose synaptic weight matrices. This implies symmetries at the synaptic level, for which there is no evidence in the brain. In this work, we propose a new variant of the algorithm, called random contrastive Hebbian learning, which does not rely on any synaptic weights symmetries. Instead, it uses random matrices to transform the feedback signals during the clamped phase, and the neural dynamics are described by first order non-linear differential equations. The algorithm is experimentally verified by solving a Boolean logic task, classification tasks (handwritten digits and letters), and an autoencoding task. This article also shows how the parameters affect learning, especially the random matrices. We use the pseudospectra analysis to investigate further how random matrices impact the learning process. Finally, we discuss the biological plausibility of the proposed algorithm, and how it can give rise to better computational models for learning.},

However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.}

Our results demonstrate that the artificial neural network provides us an effective means to model the underlying dynamics of these systems. In this paper, at first, we represent the results of the use of a multilayer feed-forward neural network to model some famous chaotic systems. The specified neural network is trained with the return maps extracted from the time series. We proceed with the paper by evaluating the accuracy and robustness of our model. The ability of the select neural network to model the dynamics of chosen chaotic systems is verified, even in the presence of noise. Afterwards, we model the brain response to the flicker light. It is known that the brain response to some stimuli such as the flicker light recorded as electroretinogram is an exemplar of chaotic behavior. The need remains, however, for realistic modeling of this behavior of the brain. In this paper, we represent the results of the modeling of this chaotic response by utilizing the proposed neural network. The capability of the neural network to model this specific brain response is confirmed.},

Generally, these problems consist of computing the optimal solution of a density function. Instead of trying to find this exact solution, a common approach is to approximate it through a learning process. In this work we propose a functional gradient rule for the maximization of a general form of density-dependent functionals using a stochastic gradient ascent algorithm. If a neural network is used for parametrization of the desired density function, the proposed learning rule can be viewed as a modulated Hebbian rule. Such a learning rule is biologically plausible, because it consists of both local and global factors corresponding to the coactivity of pre/post-synaptic neurons and the effect of neuromodulation, respectively. We first apply our technique to standard reward maximization in RL. As expected, this yields the standard policy gradient rule in which parameters of the model are updated proportional to the amount of reward. Next, we use variational free energy as a functional and find that the estimated change in parameters is modulated by a measure of surprise signal. Finally, we propose an information theoretical equivalent of existing models in expected utility maximization, as a standard model of decision making, to incorporate both individual preferences and choice variability. We show that our technique can also be applied into such novel framework.},

The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.},

Short memory lifetimes arise from the bounds that must be imposed on synaptic efficacy in any realistic model. We explored whether memory performance can be improved by allowing synapses to traverse a large number of states before reaching their bounds, or by changing the way these bounds are imposed. In the case of hard bounds, memory lifetimes grow proportional to the square of the number of synaptic states, but only if potentiation and depression are precisely balanced. Improved performance can be obtained without fine tuning by imposing soft bounds, but this improvement is only linear with respect to the number of synaptic states. We explored several other possibilities and conclude that improving memory performance requires a more radical modification of the standard model of memory storage.},

This chapter focuses on the theoretical framework and the mathematical models that have been developed to understand how these mechanisms are orchestrated to store, preserve and retrieve a large number of memories. In particular, this chapter reviews the theoretical studies on memory capacity, in which the investigators estimated how the number of storable memories scales with the number of neurons and synapses in the neural circuitry. The memory capacity depends on the complexity of the synapses, the sparseness of the representations, the spatial and temporal correlations between memories and the specific way memories are retrieved. Complexity is important when the synapses can only be modified with a limited precision, as in the case of biological synapses, and sparseness can greatly increase memory capacity and be particularly beneficial when memories are structured (correlated to each other). The theoretical tools discussed by this chapter can be harnessed to identify the important computational principles that underlie memory storage, preservation and retrieval and provide guidance in designing and interpreting memory experiments.},

All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

  abstract = {Functional and mechanistic comparisons are made between several network models of cognitive processing: competitive learning, interactive activation, adaptive resonance, and back propagation. The starting point of this comparison is the article of Rumelhart and Zipser (1985) on feature discovery through competitive learning. All the models which Rumelhart and Zipser (1985) have described were shown in Grossberg (1976b) to exhibit a type of learning which is temporally unstable. Competitive learning mechanisms can be stabilized in response to an arbitrary input environment by being supplemented with mechanisms for learning top-down expectancies, or templates; for matching bottom-up input patterns with the top-down expectancies; and for releasing orienting reactions in a mismatch situation, thereby updating short-term memory and searching for another internal representation. Network architectures which embody all of these mechanisms were called adaptive resonance models by Grossberg (1976c). Self-stabilizing learning models are candidates for use in real-world applications where unpredictable changes can occur in complex input environments. Competitive learning postulates are inconsistent with the postulates of the interactive activation model of McClelland and Rumelhart (1981), and suggest different levels of processing and interaction rules for the analysis of word recognition. Adaptive resonance models use these alternative levels and interaction rules. The selforganizing learning of an adaptive resonance model is compared and contrasted with the teacher-directed learning of a back propagation model. A number of criteria for evaluating real-time network models of cognitive processing are described and applied.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has led to significant advances in artificial intelligence, in part, by adopting strategies motivated by neurophysiology. However, it is unclear whether deep learning could occur in the real brain. Here, we show that a deep learning algorithm that utilizes multi-compartment neurons might help us to understand how the neocortex optimizes cost functions. Like neocortical pyramidal neurons, neurons in our model receive sensory information and higher-order feedback in electrotonically segregated compartments. Thanks to this segregation, neurons in different layers of the network can coordinate synaptic weight updates. As a result, the network learns to categorize images better than a single layer network. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm takes advantage of multilayer architectures to identify useful higher-order representations---the hallmark of deep learning. This work demonstrates that deep learning can be achieved using segregated dendritic compartments, which may help to explain the morphology of neocortical pyramidal neurons., Artificial intelligence has made major progress in recent years thanks to a technique known as deep learning, which works by mimicking the human brain. When computers employ deep learning, they learn by using networks made up of many layers of simulated neurons. Deep learning has opened the door to computers with human -- or even super-human -- levels of skill in recognizing images, processing speech and controlling vehicles. But many neuroscientists are skeptical about whether the brain itself performs deep learning., The patterns of activity that occur in computer networks during deep learning resemble those seen in human brains. But some features of deep learning seem incompatible with how the brain works. Moreover, neurons in artificial networks are much simpler than our own neurons. For instance, in the region of the brain responsible for thinking and planning, most neurons have complex tree-like shapes. Each cell has `roots' deep inside the brain and `branches' close to the surface. By contrast, simulated neurons have a uniform structure., To find out whether networks made up of more realistic simulated neurons could be used to make deep learning more biologically realistic, Guerguiev et al. designed artificial neurons with two compartments, similar to the `roots' and `branches'. The network learned to recognize hand-written digits more easily when it had many layers than when it had only a few. This shows that artificial neurons more like those in the brain can enable deep learning. It even suggests that our own neurons may have evolved their shape to support this process., If confirmed, the link between neuronal shape and deep learning could help us develop better brain-computer interfaces. These allow people to use their brain activity to control devices such as artificial limbs. Despite advances in computing, we are still superior to computers when it comes to learning. Understanding how our own brains show deep learning could thus help us develop better, more human-like artificial intelligence in the future.},

Though they are also reminiscent of HyperNEAT in evolution, our hypernetworks are trained end-to-end with backpropagation and thus are usually faster. The focus of this work is to make hypernetworks useful for deep convolutional networks and long recurrent networks, where hypernetworks can be viewed as relaxed form of weight-sharing across layers. Our main result is that hypernetworks can generate non-shared weights for LSTM and achieve near state-of-the-art results on a variety of sequence modelling tasks including character-level language modelling, handwriting generation and neural machine translation, challenging the weight-sharing paradigm for recurrent networks.

In this work, we propose a new DFA algorithm for BP-level accurate CNN and RNN training. Firstly, we divide the network into several modules and apply the DFA algorithm within the module. Second, the DFA with the sparse backward weight is applied. It comes with a form of dilated convolution in the CNN case, and in a form of sparse matrix multiplication in the RNN case. Additionally, the error propagation method of CNN becomes simpler through the group convolution. Finally, hybrid DFA increases the accuracy of the CNN and RNN training to the BP-level while taking advantage of the parallelism and hardware efficiency of the DFA algorithm.},

However, our recent studies using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain. These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains: compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call for a re-examination of several concepts related to the exceptionality of the human brain.},

Complexity can greatly increase memory capacity when the variables characterizing the synaptic dynamics have limited precision, as shown in simple memory retrieval problems involving random patterns. Here we turn to a real-world problem, face familiarity detection, and we show that synaptic complexity can be harnessed to store in memory a large number of faces that can be recognized at a later time. The number of recognizable faces grows almost linearly with the number of synapses and quadratically with the number of neurons. Complex synapses outperform simple ones characterized by a single variable, even when the total number of dynamical variables is matched. Complex and simple synapses have distinct signatures that are testable in experiments. Our results indicate that a system with complex synapses can be used in real-world tasks such as face familiarity detection.},

For fully-connected layers, the weight correlation is defined as the average cosine similarity between weight vectors of neurons, and for convolutional layers, the weight correlation is defined as the cosine similarity between filter matrices. Theoretically, we show that, weight correlation can, and should, be incorporated into the PAC Bayesian framework for the generalisation of neural networks, and the resulting generalisation bound is monotonic with respect to the weight correlation. We formulate a new complexity measure,  which lifts the PAC Bayes measure  with weight correlation, and experimentally confirm that it is able to rank the generalisation errors of a set of networks more precisely than existing measures. More importantly, we develop a new regulariser for training, and provide extensive experiments that show that the generalisation error can be greatly reduced with our novel approach.},

Synaptic plasticity in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) underlies this form of associative learning. Here, we summarize the molecular mechanisms that contribute to this synaptic plasticity in the context of auditory fear conditioning, the form of fear conditioning best understood at the molecular level. We discuss the neurotransmitter systems and signaling cascades that contribute to three phases of auditory fear conditioning: acquisition, consolidation, and reconsolidation. These studies suggest that multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including those triggered by activation of Hebbian processes and neuromodulatory receptors, interact to produce neural plasticity in the LA and behavioral fear conditioning. Collectively, this body of research illustrates the power of fear conditioning as a model system for characterizing the mechanisms of learning and memory in mammals and potentially for understanding fear-related disorders, such as PTSD and phobias.},

Whereas in a neural network the parameters are typically modelled as scalar values, an individual synapse in the brain comprises a complex network of interacting biochemical components that evolve at different timescales. In this paper, we show that by equipping tabular and deep reinforcement learning agents with a synaptic model that incorporates this biological complexity (Benna \& Fusi, 2016), catastrophic forgetting can be mitigated at multiple timescales. In particular, we find that as well as enabling continual learning across sequential training of two simple tasks, it can also be used to overcome within-task forgetting by reducing the need for an experience replay database.},

The synaptic weights that connect the input of the network with the hidden units can be determined through linear or nonlinear variations of a generalized Hebbian learning rule, known as Oja's rule. Various generalized Hebbian rules were experimentally tested and evaluated in terms of their effect on the convergence of the supervised training process. Several experiments indicated that the use of the proposed initialization of the internal representations significantly improves the convergence of gradient-descent-based algorithms used to perform nontrivial training tasks. The improvement of the convergence becomes significant as the size and complexity of the training task increase.},

Until recently, attempts to create local learning rules that avoid weight transport have typically failed in the large-scale learning scenarios where backpropagation shines, e.g. ImageNet categorization with deep convolutional networks. Here, we investigate a recently proposed local learning rule that yields competitive performance with backpropagation and find that it is highly sensitive to metaparameter choices, requiring laborious tuning that does not transfer across network architecture. Our analysis indicates the underlying mathematical reason for this instability, allowing us to identify a more robust local learning rule that better transfers without metaparameter tuning. Nonetheless, we find a performance and stability gap between this local rule and backpropagation that widens with increasing model depth. We then investigate several non-local learning rules that relax the need for instantaneous weight transport into a more biologically-plausible "weight estimation" process, showing that these rules match state-of-the-art performance on deep networks and operate effectively in the presence of noisy updates. Taken together, our results suggest two routes towards the discovery of neural implementations for credit assignment without weight symmetry: further improvement of local rules so that they perform consistently across architectures and the identification of biological implementations for non-local learning mechanisms.},

It enforces sequential layer updates, thus preventing efficient parallelization of the training process. Furthermore, its biological plausibility is being challenged. Alternative schemes have been devised; yet, under the constraint of synaptic asymmetry, none have scaled to modern deep learning tasks and architectures. Here, we challenge this perspective, and study the applicability of Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) to neural view synthesis, recommender systems, geometric learning, and natural language processing. In contrast with previous studies limited to computer vision tasks, our findings show that it successfully trains a large range of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, with performance close to fine-tuned backpropagation. When a larger gap between DFA and backpropagation exists, like in Transformers, we attribute this to a need to rethink common practices for large and complex architectures. At variance with common beliefs, our work supports that challenging tasks can be tackled in the absence of weight transport.},

In recent years, a complementary type of brain plasticity has been identified in myelinated axons, which make up the majority of brain's white matter. Like synaptic plasticity, myelin plasticity is required for learning, but it is unclear whether it is Hebbian or whether it follows different rules. Here, we provide evidence that white matter plasticity operates following Hebb's rule in humans. Across two experiments, we find that co-stimulating cortical areas to induce Hebbian plasticity leads to relative increases in cortical excitability and associated increases in a myelin marker within the stimulated fiber bundle. We conclude that Hebbian plasticity extends beyond synaptic changes and can be observed in human white matter fibers., {$\bullet$}Induction of Hebbian plasticity in human brain using non-invasive Hebbian stimulation{$\bullet$}Hebbian plasticity induction leads to changes within the stimulated fiber bundle{$\bullet$}Anatomically relevant behavioral changes in action reprogramming{$\bullet$}Activity-dependent white matter plasticity operates following Hebb's rule, Lazari et~al. demonstrate that Hebbian activity-dependent plasticity extends beyond synaptic changes and can be observed in human white-matter fibers.},

Using 15 different classification datasets, we systematically investigate to what extent BP really depends on weight symmetry. In a study that turned out to be surprisingly similar in spirit to Lillicrap et al.'s demonstration (Lillicrap et al. 2014) but orthogonal in its results, our experiments indicate that: (1) the magnitudes of feedback weights do not matter to performance (2) the signs of feedback weights do matter---the more concordant signs between feedforward and their corresponding feedback connections, the better (3) with feedback weights having random magnitudes and 100\% concordant signs, we were able to achieve the same or even better performance than SGD. (4) some normalizations/stabilizations are indispensable for such asymmetric BP to work, namely Batch Normalization (BN) (Ioffe and Szegedy 2015) and/or a ``Batch Manhattan'' (BM) update rule.},

  abstract = {The brain processes information through multiple layers of neurons. This deep architecture is representationally powerful, but complicates learning because it is difficult to identify the responsible neurons when a mistake is made. In machine learning, the backpropagation algorithm assigns blame by multiplying error signals with all the synaptic weights on each neuron's axon and further downstream. However, this involves a precise, symmetric backward connectivity pattern, which is thought to be impossible in the brain. Here we demonstrate that this strong architectural constraint is not required for effective error propagation. We present a surprisingly simple mechanism that assigns blame by multiplying errors by even random synaptic weights. This mechanism can transmit teaching signals across multiple layers of neurons and performs as effectively as backpropagation on a variety of tasks. Our results help reopen questions about how the brain could use error signals and dispel long-held assumptions about algorithmic constraints on learning.,  Multi-layered neural architectures that implement learning require elaborate mechanisms for symmetric backpropagation of errors that are biologically implausible. Here the authors propose a simple resolution to this problem of blame assignment that works even with feedback using random synaptic weights.},

In the cortex, synapses are embedded within multilayered networks, making it difficult to determine the effect of an individual synaptic modification on the behaviour of the system. The backpropagation algorithm solves this problem in deep artificial neural networks, but historically it has been viewed as biologically problematic. Nonetheless, recent developments in neuroscience and the successes of artificial neural networks have reinvigorated interest in whether backpropagation offers insights for understanding learning in the cortex. The backpropagation algorithm learns quickly by computing synaptic updates using feedback connections to deliver error signals. Although feedback connections are ubiquitous in the cortex, it is difficult to see how they could deliver the error signals required by strict formulations of backpropagation. Here we build on past and recent developments to argue that feedback connections may instead induce neural activities whose differences can be used to locally approximate these signals and hence drive effective learning in deep networks in the brain.},

It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum.

  abstract = {Backpropagation is a cornerstone algorithm in training neural networks for supervised learning, which uses a gradient descent method to update network weights by minimizing the discrepancy between actual and desired outputs. Despite its pivotal role in propelling deep learning advancements, the biological plausibility of backpropagation is questioned due to its requirements for weight symmetry, global error computation, and dual-phase training. To address this long-standing challenge, many studies have endeavored to devise biologically plausible training algorithms. However, a fully biologically plausible algorithm for training multilayer neural networks remains elusive, and interpretations of biological plausibility vary among researchers. In this study, we establish criteria for biological plausibility that a desirable learning algorithm should meet. Using these criteria, we evaluate a range of existing algorithms considered to be biologically plausible, including Hebbian learning, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, feedback alignment, target propagation, predictive coding, forward-forward algorithm, perturbation learning, local losses, and energy-based learning. Additionally, we empirically evaluate these algorithms across diverse network architectures and datasets. We compare the feature representations learned by these algorithms with brain activity recorded by non-invasive devices under identical stimuli, aiming to identify which algorithm can most accurately replicate brain activity patterns. We are hopeful that this study could inspire the development of new biologically plausible algorithms for training multilayer networks, thereby fostering progress in both the fields of neuroscience and machine learning.},

Brain--machine interfaces (BMIs) offer users the ability to directly communicate with digital devices through neural signals decoded with machine learning (ML)-based algorithms. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that operate on neural spikes instead of continuous scalar outputs. Compared to traditional ANNs, SNNs perform fewer computations, use less memory, and mimic biological neurons better. However, SNNs only retain information for short durations, limiting their ability to capture long-term dependencies in time-variant data. Here, we propose a novel spike-weighted SNN with spiking long short-term memory (swSNN-SLSTM) for a regression problem. Spike-weighting captures neuronal firing rate instead of membrane potential, and the SLSTM layer captures long-term dependencies. Methods. We compared the performance of various ML algorithms during decoding directional movements, using a dataset of microelectrode recordings from a macaque during a directional joystick task, and also an open-source dataset. We thus quantified how swSNN-SLSTM performed compared to existing ML models: an unscented Kalman filter, LSTM-based ANN, and membrane-based SNN techniques. Result. The proposed swSNN-SLSTM outperforms both the unscented Kalman filter, the LSTM-based ANN, and the membrane based SNN technique. This shows that incorporating SLSTM can better capture long-term dependencies within neural data. Also, our proposed swSNN-SLSTM algorithm shows promise in reducing power consumption and lowering heat dissipation in implanted BMIs.},

Typically, this involves minimizing a surrogate objective, such as the negative log likelihood of a generative model, with the hope that representations useful for subsequent tasks will arise as a side effect. In this work, we propose instead to directly target later desired tasks by meta-learning an unsupervised learning rule which leads to representations useful for those tasks. Specifically, we target semi-supervised classification performance, and we meta-learn an algorithm --an unsupervised weight update rule -- that produces representations useful for this task. Additionally, we constrain our unsupervised update rule to a be a biologically-motivated, neuron-local function, which enables it to generalize to different neural network architectures, datasets, and data modalities. We show that the meta-learned update rule produces useful features and sometimes outperforms existing unsupervised learning techniques. We further show that the meta-learned unsupervised update rule generalizes to train networks with different widths, depths, and nonlinearities. It also generalizes to train on data with randomly permuted input dimensions and even generalizes from image datasets to a text task.},

This has led to renewed interest in developing analogies between the backpropagation learning algorithm used to train artificial networks and the synaptic plasticity rules operative in the brain. These efforts are challenged by biologically implausible features of backpropagation, one of which is a reliance on symmetric forward and backward synaptic weights. A number of methods have been proposed that do not rely on weight symmetry but, thus far, these have failed to scale to deep convolutional networks and complex data. We identify principal obstacles to the scalability of such algorithms and introduce several techniques to mitigate them. We demonstrate that a modification of the feedback alignment method that enforces a weaker form of weight symmetry, one that requires agreement of weight sign but not magnitude, can achieve performance competitive with backpropagation. Our results complement those of Bartunov et al. (2018) and Xiao et al.

In addition to providing mathematical arguments for the effectiveness of the new learning rule, we show through simulations that it can be used to train an RNN to perform a variety of tasks.

Crucial scientific applications such as weather forecasting and climate modeling depend on the ability to effectively model spatiotemporal chaotic geophysical systems such as the atmosphere and oceans. Recent advances in the field of machine learning have the potential to be an important tool for modeling such systems.

  abstract = {Experience-dependent learning and memory require multiple forms of plasticity at hippocampal and cortical synapses that are regulated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA) and {$\alpha$}-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDAR, AMPAR). These plasticity mechanisms include long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), which are Hebbian input-specific mechanisms that rapidly increase or decrease AMPAR synaptic strength at specific inputs, and homeostatic plasticity that globally scales-up or -down AMPAR synaptic strength across many or even all inputs. Frequently, these changes in synaptic strength are also accompanied by a change in the subunit composition of AMPARs at the synapse due to the trafficking to and from the synapse of receptors lacking GluA2 subunits. These GluA2-lacking receptors are most often GluA1 homomeric receptors that exhibit higher single-channel conductance and are Ca2+-permeable (CP-AMPAR). This review article will focus on the role of protein phosphorylation in regulation of GluA1 CP-AMPAR recruitment and removal from hippocampal synapses during synaptic plasticity with an emphasis on the crucial role of local signaling by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the Ca2+calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin (CaN) that is coordinated by the postsynaptic scaffold protein A-kinase anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP79/150).},

Conversely, artificial intelligence attempts to design computational systems based on the tasks they will have to solve. In the case of artificial neural networks, the three components specified by design are the objective functions, the learning rules, and architectures. With the growing success of deep learning, which utilizes brain-inspired architectures, these three designed components have increasingly become central to how we model, engineer and optimize complex artificial learning systems. Here we argue that a greater focus on these components would also benefit systems neuroscience. We give examples of how this optimization-based framework can drive theoretical and experimental progress in neuroscience.

Rules that train neural networks to map stimuli onto outputs are given by supervised learning and reinforcement learning theories. Supervised learning is efficient but biologically implausible. In contrast, reinforcement learning is biologically plausible but comparatively inefficient. It lacks a mechanism that can identify units at early processing levels that play a decisive role in the stimulus-response mapping. Here we show that this so-called credit assignment problem can be solved by a new role for attention in learning. There are two factors in our new learning scheme that determine synaptic plasticity: (1) a reinforcement signal that is homogeneous across the network and depends on the amount of reward obtained after a trial, and (2) an attentional feedback signal from the output layer that limits plasticity to those units at earlier processing levels that are crucial for the stimulus-response mapping. The new scheme is called attention-gated reinforcement learning (AGREL). We show that it is as efficient as supervised learning in classification tasks. AGREL is biologically realistic and integrates the role of feedback connections, attention effects, synaptic plasticity, and reinforcement learning signals into a coherent framework.},

In our generalized framework, networks have neither explicit notion of nor ever receive gradients. The synapses and neurons are updated using a bidirectional Hebb-style update rule parameterized by a shared low-dimensional "genome". We show that such genomes can be meta-learned from scratch, using either conventional optimization techniques, or evolutionary strategies, such as CMA-ES. Resulting update rules generalize to unseen tasks and train faster than gradient descent based optimizers for several standard computer vision and synthetic tasks.},

Despite its pervasiveness, the exact reasons for BatchNorm's effectiveness are still poorly understood. The popular belief is that this effectiveness stems from controlling the change of the layers' input distributions during training to reduce the so-called "internal covariate shift". In this work, we demonstrate that such distributional stability of layer inputs has little to do with the success of BatchNorm. Instead, we uncover a more fundamental impact of BatchNorm on the training process: it makes the optimization landscape significantly smoother. This smoothness induces a more predictive and stable behavior of the gradients, allowing for faster training.},

  abstract = {We introduce Equilibrium Propagation, a learning framework for energy-based models. It involves only one kind of neural computation, performed in both the first phase (when the prediction is made) and the second phase of training (after the target or prediction error is revealed). Although this algorithm computes the gradient of an objective function just like Backpropagation, it does not need a special computation or circuit for the second phase, where errors are implicitly propagated. Equilibrium Propagation shares similarities with Contrastive Hebbian Learning and Contrastive Divergence while solving the theoretical issues of both algorithms: our algorithm computes the gradient of a well defined objective function. Because the objective function is defined in terms of local perturbations, the second phase of Equilibrium Propagation corresponds to only nudging the prediction (fixed point, or stationary distribution) towards a configuration that reduces prediction error. In the case of a recurrent multi-layer supervised network, the output units are slightly nudged towards their target in the second phase, and the perturbation introduced at the output layer propagates backward in the hidden layers. We show that the signal 'back-propagated' during this second phase corresponds to the propagation of error derivatives and encodes the gradient of the objective function, when the synaptic update corresponds to a standard form of spike-timing dependent plasticity. This work makes it more plausible that a mechanism similar to Backpropagation could be implemented by brains, since leaky integrator neural computation performs both inference and error back-propagation in our model. The only local difference between the two phases is whether synaptic changes are allowed or not.},

Random feedback alignment offers an alternative model in which errors are propagated backward through fixed, random backward connections. This approach successfully trains shallow models, but learns slowly and does not perform well with deeper models or online learning. In this study, we develop a meta-learning approach to discover interpretable, biologically plausible plasticity rules that improve online learning performance with fixed random feedback connections. The resulting plasticity rules show improved online training of deep models in the low data regime. Our results highlight the potential of meta-learning to discover effective, interpretable learning rules satisfying biological constraints.},

Despite their critical role in training DNNs, these engineering tricks are often overlooked when drawing parallels between biological and artificial networks, potentially due to a lack of evidence for their direct biological implementation. In this study, we show that Oja's plasticity rule partly overcomes the need for some engineering tricks. Specifically, under difficult, but biologically realistic learning scenarios such as online learning, deep architectures, and sub-optimal weight initialization, Oja's rule can substantially improve the performance of pure backpropagation. Our results demonstrate that simple synaptic plasticity rules can overcome challenges to learning that are typically overcome using less biologically plausible approaches when training DNNs.},

Natural processing architectures are characterized by recurrence and therefore exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics. Moreover, they use learning mechanisms that support self-organization. It is proposed that these properties allow for computations that are notoriously difficult to realize in artificial systems. Experimental evidence on the organization and function of the cerebral cortex is reviewed that supports this proposal.},

  abstract = {Training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has become a go-to approach for generating and evaluating mechanistic neural hypotheses for cognition. The ease and efficiency of training RNNs with backpropagation through time and the availability of robustly supported deep learning libraries has made RNN modeling more approachable and accessible to neuroscience. Yet, a major technical hindrance remains. Cognitive processes such as working memory and decision making involve neural population dynamics over a long period of time within a behavioral trial and across trials. It is difficult to train RNNs to accomplish tasks where neural representations and dynamics have long temporal dependencies without gating mechanisms such as LSTMs or GRUs which currently lack experimental support and prohibit direct comparison between RNNs and biological neural circuits. We tackled this problem based on the idea of specialized skip-connections through time to support the emergence of task-relevant dynamics, and subsequently reinstitute biological plausibility by reverting to the original architecture. We show that this approach enables RNNs to successfully learn cognitive tasks that prove impractical if not impossible to learn using conventional methods. Over numerous tasks considered here, we achieve less training steps and shorter wall-clock times, particularly in tasks that require learning long-term dependencies via temporal integration over long timescales or maintaining a memory of past events in hidden-states. Our methods expand the range of experimental tasks that biologically plausible RNN models can learn, thereby supporting the development of theory for the emergent neural mechanisms of computations involving long-term dependencies.},

  abstract = {The common procedure in reservoir computing is to take a ``found'' reservoir, such as a recurrent neural network with randomly chosen synaptic weights or a complex physical device, and to adapt the weights of linear readouts from this reservoir for a particular computing task. We address the question of whether the performance of reservoir computing can be significantly enhanced if one instead optimizes some (hyper)parameters of the reservoir, not for a single task but for the range of all possible tasks in which one is potentially interested, before the weights of linear readouts are optimized for a particular computing task. After all, networks of neurons in the brain are also known to be not randomly connected. Rather, their structure and parameters emerge from complex evolutionary and developmental processes, arguably in a way that enhances the speed and accuracy of subsequent learning of any concrete task that is likely to be essential for the survival of the organism. We apply the Learning-to-Learn (L2L) paradigm to mimic this two-tier process, where a set of (hyper)parameters of the reservoir are optimized for a whole family of learning tasks. We found that this substantially enhances the performance of reservoir computing for the families of tasks that we considered. Furthermore, L2L enables a new form of reservoir learning that tends to enable even faster learning, where not even the weights of readouts need to be adjusted for learning a concrete task. We present demos and performance results of these new forms of reservoir computing for reservoirs that consist of networks of spiking neurons and are hence of particular interest from the perspective of neuroscience and implementations in spike-based neuromorphic hardware. We leave it as an open question of what performance advantage the new methods that we propose provide for other types of reservoirs.},

  abstract = {Reservoir computing is a computational framework suited for temporal/sequential data processing. It is derived from several recurrent neural network models, including echo state networks and liquid state machines. A reservoir computing system consists of a reservoir for mapping inputs into a high-dimensional space and a readout for pattern analysis from the high-dimensional states in the reservoir. The reservoir is fixed and only the readout is trained with a simple method such as linear regression and classification. Thus, the major advantage of reservoir computing compared to other recurrent neural networks is fast learning, resulting in low training cost. Another advantage is that the reservoir without adaptive updating is amenable to hardware implementation using a variety of physical systems, substrates, and devices. In fact, such physical reservoir computing has attracted increasing attention in diverse fields of research. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of recent advances in physical reservoir computing by classifying them according to the type of the reservoir. We discuss the current issues and perspectives related to physical reservoir computing, in order to further expand its practical applications and develop next-generation machine learning systems.},

However, it is challenging to operate very large-scale neural networks with low-power hardware devices, partly due to signal transmissions through a massive number of interconnections. Our aim is to deal with the issue of communication cost from an algorithmic viewpoint and study learning algorithms for energy-efficient information processing. Here, we consider two approaches to finding spatially arranged sparse recurrent neural networks with the high cost-performance ratio for associative memory. In the first approach following classical methods, we focus on sparse modular network structures inspired by biological brain networks and examine their storage capacity under an iterative learning rule. We show that incorporating long-range intermodule connections into purely modular networks can enhance the cost-performance ratio. In the second approach, we formulate for the first time an optimization problem where the network sparsity is maximized under the constraints imposed by a pattern embedding condition. We show that there is a tradeoff between the interconnection cost and the computational performance in the optimized networks. We demonstrate that the optimized networks can achieve a better cost-performance ratio compared with those considered in the first approach. We show the effectiveness of the optimization approach mainly using binary patterns and apply it also to gray-scale image restoration. Our results suggest that the presented approaches are useful in seeking more sparse and less costly connectivity of neural networks for the enhancement of energy efficiency in hardware neural networks.},

  abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, for computer vision in particular. In this approach, a deep (multilayer) artificial neural network (ANN) is trained, most often in a supervised manner using backpropagation. Vast amounts of labeled training examples are required, but the resulting classification accuracy is truly impressive, sometimes outperforming humans. Neurons in an ANN are characterized by a single, static, continuous-valued activation. Yet biological neurons use discrete spikes to compute and transmit information, and the spike times, in addition to the spike rates, matter. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are thus more biologically realistic than ANNs, and are arguably the only viable option if one wants to understand how the brain computes at the neuronal description level. The spikes of biological neurons are sparse in time and space, and event-driven. Combined with bio-plausible local learning rules, this makes it easier to build low-power, neuromorphic hardware for SNNs. However, training deep SNNs remains a challenge. Spiking neurons' transfer function is usually non-differentiable, which prevents using backpropagation. Here we review recent supervised and unsupervised methods to train deep SNNs, and compare them in terms of accuracy and computational cost. The emerging picture is that SNNs still lag behind ANNs in terms of accuracy, but the gap is decreasing, and can even vanish on some tasks, while SNNs typically require many fewer operations and are the better candidates to process spatio-temporal data.},

A reservoir computing system consists of a reservoir part represented as a sparsely connected recurrent neural network and a readout part represented as a simple regression model. In machine learning tasks, the reservoir part is fixed and only the readout part is trained. Although reservoir computing has been mainly applied to time series prediction and recognition, it can be applied to image recognition as well by considering an image data as a sequence of pixel values. However, to achieve a high performance in image recognition with raw image data, a large-scale reservoir including a large number of neurons is required. This is a bottleneck in terms of computer memory and computational cost. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a new method which combines reservoir computing with untrained convolutional neural networks. We use an untrained convolutional neural network to transform raw image data into a set of smaller feature maps in a preprocessing step of the reservoir computing. We demonstrate that our method achieves a high classification accuracy in an image recognition task with a much smaller number of trainable parameters compared with a previous study.},

Recent studies in both heterologous expression systems and cultured neurons have shown that the AMPA receptor can be phosphorylated on their subunits (GluR1, GluR2, and GluR4). All phosphorylation sites reside at serine, threonine, or tyrosine on the intracellular C-terminal domain. Several key protein kinases, such as protein kinase A, protein kinase C, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and tyrosine kinases (Trks; receptor or nonreceptor family Trks) are involved in the site-specific regulation of the AMPA receptor phosphorylation. Other glutamate receptors (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors) also regulate AMPA receptors through a protein phosphorylation mechanism. Emerging evidence shows that as a rapid and short-term mechanism, the dynamic protein phosphorylation directly modulates the electrophysiological, morphological (externalization and internalization trafficking and clustering), and biochemical (synthesis and subunit composition) properties of the AMPA receptor, as well as protein-protein interactions between the AMPA receptor subunits and various intracellular interacting proteins. These modulations underlie the major molecular mechanisms that ultimately affect many forms of synaptic plasticity.},

To achieve this, we first examined the process by which axons develop and how synapses form in micropatterned primary neurons using immunocytochemistry. By aligning asymmetric micropatterns with a marginal gap, it was possible to pattern primary neurons with a directed polarization axis at the single-cell level. We then examined how synapses develop on micropatterned hippocampal neurons. Three types of micropatterns with different numbers of short paths for dendrite growth were compared. A normal development in synapse density was observed when micropatterns with three or more short paths were used. Finally, we performed double patch clamp recordings on micropatterned neurons to confirm that these synapses are indeed functional, and that the neuronal signal is transmitted unidirectionally in the intended orientation. This work provides a practical guideline for patterning single neurons to design functional neuronal networks in vitro with the direction of signal propagation being controlled.},

During training, only the connections from the reservoir to these output units are learned. A key requisite for output-only training is the echo state property (ESP), which means that the effect of initial conditions should vanish as time passes. In this paper, we use analytical examples to show that a widely used criterion for the ESP, the spectral radius of the weight matrix being smaller than unity, is not sufficient to satisfy the echo state property. We obtain these examples by investigating local bifurcation properties of the standard ESNs. Moreover, we provide new sufficient conditions for the echo state property of standard sigmoid and leaky integrator ESNs. We furthermore suggest an improved technical definition of the echo state property, and discuss what practicians should (and should not) observe when they optimize their reservoirs for specific tasks.},

  abstract = {Discriminative Fine-Tuning is a fine-tuning strategy that is used for ULMFiT type models. Instead of using the same learning rate for all layers of the model, discriminative fine-tuning allows us to tune each layer with different learning rates. For context, the regular stochastic gradient descent (SGD) update of a model's parameters \${\textbackslash}theta\$ at time step \$t\$ looks like the following (Ruder, 2016): \$\$ {\textbackslash}theta\_\{t\} = {\textbackslash}theta\_\{t-1\} - {\textbackslash}eta{\textbackslash}cdot{\textbackslash}nabla\_\{{\textbackslash}theta\}J{\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}theta{\textbackslash}right)\$\$ where \${\textbackslash}eta\$ is the learning rate and \${\textbackslash}nabla\_\{{\textbackslash}theta\}J{\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}theta{\textbackslash}right)\$ is the gradient with regard to the model's objective function. For discriminative fine-tuning, we split the parameters \${\textbackslash}theta\$ into \{\${\textbackslash}theta\_\{1\}, {\textbackslash}ldots, {\textbackslash}theta\_\{L\}\$\} where \${\textbackslash}theta\_\{l\}\$ contains the parameters of the model at the \$l\$-th layer and \$L\$ is the number of layers of the model. Similarly, we obtain \{\${\textbackslash}eta\_\{1\}, {\textbackslash}ldots, {\textbackslash}eta\_\{L\}\$\} where \${\textbackslash}theta\_\{l\}\$ where \${\textbackslash}eta\_\{l\}\$ is the learning rate of the \$l\$-th layer. The SGD update with discriminative finetuning is then: \$\$ {\textbackslash}theta\_\{t\}{\textasciicircum}\{l\} = {\textbackslash}theta\_\{t-1\}{\textasciicircum}\{l\} - {\textbackslash}eta{\textasciicircum}\{l\}{\textbackslash}cdot{\textbackslash}nabla\_\{{\textbackslash}theta{\textasciicircum}\{l\}\}J{\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}theta{\textbackslash}right) \$\$ The authors find that empirically it worked well to first choose the learning rate \${\textbackslash}eta{\textasciicircum}\{L\}\$ of the last layer by fine-tuning only the last layer and using \${\textbackslash}eta{\textasciicircum}\{l-1\}={\textbackslash}eta{\textasciicircum}\{l\}/2.6\$ as the learning rate for lower layers.},
